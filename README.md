# Summariser
Summarises article text. The user is able to copy and paste text into a text box, or upload the desired text to be summarized. The user is then able to select the desired summary length and submit the article text. The ouput is a summary composed from the most similar sentences which best represent the article as a whole.

### Improvements/Lessons to take for next project.
1. Rewrite summariser.py to follow [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2. Rewrite summariser.py to also follow [PEP 257 -- Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
3. Condense oversized functions into smaller and more managable portions.
4. Implement a class for article text.
