                <h3>How-to</h3>
                <p>
Upload an article through a text file or by pasting the content in the text box. The first option of either form limits
the number of sentences within the summary. The second option specifies a percentage by which to reduce the article.
When reducing the article size through the second option, the amount removed is approximate. In other words, the
application will make attempts at reducing the article size by the specified value.
                </p>
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The application was built from libraries and tools pre installed in the CS50 IDE, therefore it is limited to using only these assets.</li>
                        <li>UTF-8 is a very common standard for online web pages, yet interestingly enough I've found a few article with characters and symbols outside of this standard.</li>
                        <li>The application can only construct summaries by reusing sentences from the article.</li>
                        <li>The application is inconsistent in determining a sentence or paragraph.</li>
                        <li>Canâ€™t paste url to scrap article</li>
                        <li>The application is unable to determine the underlying subject of an article, and thus unable construct a more dynamic summary.</li>
                        <li>Shrinking the browser window distorts the webpage.</li>
                        <li>Using a screen aspect ratio other than 16:10 can potentially cut off content.</li>
                        <li>Built and tested on Chrome, serviceable apearance on other web browsers is unknown.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Improvements</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Expand utf decoding.</li>
                        <li>Include search by url and html scraping.</li>
                        <li>Improve compatibility with different monitor setups and web browsers.</li>
                        <li>When the specified summary size permits, parse the summary into paragraphs.</li>
                        <li>An improved set of rules could improve summary construction to be more succinct and comprehensive.</li>
                        <li>Robusts statistical approaches could improve the selection of sentences, and even subjects.</li>
                        <li>Machine learning could improve overall functionality by piggybacking off of statistical data.</li>
                        <li>Leverage libraries and open source code from github.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Thoughts for the future</h3>
                <p>
This application would ideally become part of a larger tool that would aggregate articles of similar subjects and display comparisons between them,
while also providing summaries of the common points that are shared amongst articles.
The tool would not be a replacement for reading the articles themselves since the summaries would be lacking in detail and context.
In this day and age it is easy for the reader to become saturated with the abundance of information.
Therefore a tool which is capable of condensing quantitative bits of information, sieved from the opinions of writers, would, I belive, be of a nontrivial benefit to people.

                </p>
                <p>
This would at the very least make evident the differences between sources and their respective facts and opinions.
Furthermore, a tool such as this would need to be open source as to prevent or eliminate any conscious or unconscious bias within the software itself.
This kind of tool would likely have to be locally installed by the user as either an extension or a standalone program since the tool would be storing content from publishers.
The content would be used for side by side comparisons and referenced for later use. It would be a major plus if the tool were able to discern external references and also be capable of searching for them.
Then again, who uses references anymore, amirite?
